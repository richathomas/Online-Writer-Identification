The online writer identification using sparse coding based descriptor is a system used to identify the author
of online handwritten documents. The features from each sub-strokes are extracted using local and global
feature extraction. The features extracted are used for generating descriptors. The Sparse coding framework
generates the descriptors for the handwritten trace of a writer and the descriptors are derived from a set of
dictionary atoms. The descriptors for each dictionary atom encode the error while using it alone for reconstruction. The use of sparse representation offers flexibility in describing each of the segmented handwritten
sub-strokes of a writer as a combination of more than one atom. The descriptor is constructed by considering
the attributes obtained from sets of histograms extracted at the sub-stroke level. An entropy-based analysis
for the bin size to be used for obtaining a proper bin size to arrange the features extracted. By selecting a
proper bin it increases the discrimination of descriptors between the writers. The unique descriptors generated for each document represents the author of the corresponding document. The writer descriptor is
evaluated on each individual text lines of the IAM online English database.
